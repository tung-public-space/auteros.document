== Description ==

* Clever Mega Menu for Elementor (aka @CMM4E) is a top-notch mega menu extension for Elementor. It allows you creating a fully responsive mega menu with dropdown items, rich in content modules, all the process clear and easy.

== IMPORTANT NOTES ==
* **Clever Mega Menu for Elementor will not automatically adopt the style of your theme**, unless your theme has an CMM4E-specific stylesheet. You’ll need to customize the styles on your own to recreate it if that’s what you want.
* Please DO NOT ask for making this plugin to work with **Elementor Pro's Nav Menu** Widget!
* The **Elementor Pro's Nav Menu** widget is not designed for mega menus. We also SHOULD NOT override behaviors of Elementor Pro widgets. This plugin has its own widgets and behaviors.


See [Demo](http://cmm4e.wp1.zootemplate.com/) and [Online Documentation](https://doc.cleveraddon.com/clever-mega-menu-elementor) for more info.
